<b> ARM based SemiAutonomous Tennis Balls collector </b>
<br />
This robot was part of my B.Tech thesis. <br />
The project purpose is to use an OpenCV-based  machine-vision to collect the balls in a tennis court. <br />
<br />
Some technologies used are listed below. <br />
<br />
For robot: <br />
+ OpenCV imaging library <br />
+ Linux-based embedded system in an ARM microcontroller <br />
+ Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization - CLAHE  <br />
<br />
For the controller: <br />
+ Web based development <br />
+ Websockets via websockify <br />
